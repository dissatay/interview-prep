good:
- explained what IG is 
- asked what should i build
- like how you said it would be inefficient to load all the data when a user launches the app
- you know a lot of rules that build credibility ( 3 to 1 ) 

improve on:
- didnt mention daily users vs total. only considered daily
- everything is a box. maybe put some parameters in the boxes other than the name
- nothing is to scale really. 
- maybe introduce what you will be designing diagram wise at a high level before going into it
